				Hi, I'm Lukas a certified Data Analyst who works as an Analytics Developer. Today it's my job to make data human-friendly and usable,
				I like it! But I was not always wrangling data why I would describe myself as kind of hybrid: For nearly ten years I worked as a project
				manager in the primary and reinsurance industry, where I headed the PMO of a large IT-transformation project for two years.
			</p>

				During that time I felt like I want to deal with data professionally instead of linking dozens of excel files,
				creating Gannt charts with Think Cell and reporting to the managmenet with power point slides - I'm sure you know what I mean.ðŸ˜€
				As I was always keen on IT and web technologies I started programming in Python,
				learning SQL (and JavaScript because I like the D3 library) - it is a never-ending journey!
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm learning from other people who share their knowledge, this is why I share mine here as well.
				Let's start with a post on how to annotate a barplot in seaborn, because knowing this earlier would have saved
				me a lot of time during my practical Data Analyst certification exam. Have fun!
