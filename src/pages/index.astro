			<p>
			The stack I use at work is mainly R (Shiny-App) and SQL (Snowflake, DBeaver).
			Here and there I use Python for data cleaning and transformation and in addition
			to that I support my colleagues in Power BI.

			My way into data was everything but straight. For more than a decade I worked as a
			Project Manager in the primary and reinsurance industry. After having led the PMO
			of a large IT-transformation project I wanted to deal with data more professional.</p>
